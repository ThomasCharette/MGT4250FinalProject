## Project Description
### Questions of Interest
## What is the Impact of Interest Rates and Unemployment Rate on Savings Rate?

### Importance statement
This question is important because insights into monetary policy, such as interest rates, have a huge role in how central banks manage unemployment, regulate inflation, and affect economic activity. Seeing their effect on consumer behavior is crucial to determining the success of monetary policy.  

Another major aspect is concerning economic growth and stability. Interest rates and unemployment data have widespread effects on the direction of our economy. Analyzing savings rates linked to interest and unemployment is important to assess the state of the economy and its potential growth, as saving rates have a large impact on GDP and capital availability for investment. That could be either spending decreases or business activity skyrocketing; the list goes on. 

Lastly, these outcomes are directly related to consumer behavior. Translating a dataset into real-world analysis is often just as important as the statistical analysis of the dataset. Getting a comprehensive view of the economic situation relies on answering questions such as this and understanding consumer behavior

### Discussion & Summary
Our data was collected from Kaggle, a well-respected and legitimate website used by students and professionals. Alongside this, we have used scholarly sources such as Diyah Ayu Wulansari and P Eko Prasetyo's paper on “The Effect of Economic Growth, Unemployment, and Savings on Interest Rates and Inflation” outlining general economic trends and relationships between Inflation, interest rates, savings, economic growth, and unemployment, specifically in Indonesia. While most of our focus and findings are on the U.S. markets, these topics still apply, and provide a different perspective.
