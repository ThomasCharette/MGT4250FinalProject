## What is the Impact of Interest Rates and Unemployment Rate on Savings Rate?

### Importance statement
This question is important because insights into monetary policy, such as interest rates, have a huge role in how central banks manage unemployment, regulate inflation, and affect economic activity. Seeing their effect on consumer behavior is crucial to determining the success of monetary policy.  

Another major aspect is concerning economic growth and stability. Interest rates and unemployment data have widespread effects on the direction of our economy. Analyzing savings rates linked to interest and unemployment is important to assess the state of the economy and its potential growth, as saving rates have a large impact on GDP and capital availability for investment. That could be either spending decreases or business activity skyrocketing; the list goes on. 

Lastly, these outcomes are directly related to consumer behavior. Translating a dataset into real-world analysis is often just as important as the statistical analysis of the dataset. Getting a comprehensive view of the economic situation relies on answering questions such as this and understanding consumer behavior



### Data Description
Our data was collected from Kaggle, a well-respected and legitimate website used by students and professionals. Alongside this, we have used scholarly sources such as Diyah Ayu Wulansari and P Eko Prasetyo's paper on “The Effect of Economic Growth, Unemployment, and Savings on Interest Rates and Inflation” outlining general economic trends and relationships between Inflation, interest rates, savings, economic growth, and unemployment, specifically in Indonesia. While most of our focus and findings are on the U.S. markets, these topics still apply, and provide a different perspective. 

### Interpreting Visualizations
## Graph 1

A correlation matrix is a perfect representation to analyze the impact on savings rates with a side-by-side comparison. A matrix allows you to see how related changes in variables are to one another. By the looks of it, the personal saving rate and unemployment rate (.50) indicated a somewhat positive relationship. There exists a trend for a personal savings rate to rise in line with the unemployment rate. This suggests that people who have savings may be more likely to save a sa precaution when more people lose their jobs. 
Additionally, interest rates and the unemployment rate (.25) show a positive relationship. Interest rates may rise in line with an increase in the unemployment rate, although the correlation is weaker. This may be seen as central banks responding to unemployment by changing interest rates, but there are other important forces at work as well. Lastly, interest rates and the personal saving rate (.28) likewise shows a weak positive correlation. It implies that there may be a little increase in personal savings rates in line with rising interest rates. This may be because interest rates offer a better return on savings, however the correlation is not very strong.

A side-by-side of the three variables over time gives the audience a better understanding of the volatility each of these measures has. It’s also a great representation of the variables against each other. For example, you can see that the interest rates weren’t drastically different in 2020 and moved inversely to savings and unemployment rates. 
There are cyclical trends in the unemployment rate, with peaks corresponding with recessions or downturns in the economy. Notable peaks can be observed, for instance, in the early 1980’s, and early 1990s, the 2008 financial crisis, and the sharp spike around 2020, which is related to the effects of the pandemic. The middle graph, although it seems to be rather steady, the personal savings rate shows considerable rises during recessionary times, including the early 1980s, and 2008, and a notable peak in 2020. The bottom graph shows that Interest rates have been on a general downward trend since the 1980s and there are small upticks in interest rates visible shortly after economic downturns, but the overall long-term trend is declining. This also shows that interest rates have been low since the 2008 financial crisis, which aligns with central bank policies aimed at stimulating economic activity by making borrowing cheaper.

## Graph 3

The “Interest Rate Level vs. Average Personal Savings Rate” bar chart visualizes the average personal savings rate in various interest rate settings visually. The average savings rate is slightly higher in low-interest rate scenarios (above .08) and reaches its peak in high-interest rate conditions (just above .09), indicating a non-linear relationship that suggests that people are more likely to save when potential returns on savings are high. On the other hand, in situations with medium interest rates, the average savings rate falls to less than .06 which suggests the presence of a threshold effect or the impact of other economic factors that moderate savings behavior. This graph highlights how closely the savings rate responds to changes in interest rates, putting stress on oversimplified theories of a direct or proportionate relationship and showing the complicated interactions between these two important economic variables.
